# Data
Some data files couldn't be uploaded because of Gits 100MB file limit. Missing are 
- the glove embeddings (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
- the Fasttext embeddings (https://fasttext.cc/)
- the finetuned Fasttext model (can be provided if wanted. However, it isn't any good. So why should you want it, anyway??)

The other data was either created or used in the process of the paper.

- _Gab-Hate-Corpus_ contains data from (https://osf.io/edua3/)
- _RNSB_classifiers_ contains pickled logistic regression classifiers for the hatefulness metric
- _davidson_ contains data from (https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language)
- _hate_words_ contains pickled data fetched from the weaponized Word API, courtesy of The Weaponized Word (https://www.weaponizedword.org) (however, because of licensing, the data is removed!)
- _implicit-hate-corpus_ contains data from (https://github.com/GT-SALT/implicit-hate)
