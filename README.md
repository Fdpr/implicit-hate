# implicit hate speech detection
 Here are all the files for the project. Details of the process can be found in the paper, but all code should be sufficiently documented to understand it anyway.
 
 All the files are contained in three folders:
 - _source_ contains all the python code that was constructed in the making of the paper. It is stored as jupyter notebooks.
 - _data_ contains all relevant data used. Almost all data is third-party data. Credits can be found in the paper.
 - _implicit_hate_classifier_ contains a pickled version of the final product, the classifier model, as well as instructions for how to set it up and use it.
