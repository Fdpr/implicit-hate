# Source files
Each of the 4 notebooks correspond to a different step of the work.
- _first_setup_ contains all relevant code up to and including chapter 3.4 of the paper.
- _fasttext_finetuning_ contains the code from chapter 3.5
- _weaponized word fetch_ contains the code from chapter 3.6.1 (lexicon obfuscated because of copyright)
- _implicit_hate_model_ contains all the code from the rest of the chapters.

## Note
All code was run on Python 3.8. Paths to files are probably broken because some paths need to be absolute. If relative paths don't work, try putting all of the data folder into the source folder. That should work!
